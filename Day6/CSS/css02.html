        <span>Animals</span> are multicellular,
        eukaryotic organisms comprising the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]).
        With few exceptions, <span>animals</span>
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can
        reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. <span>Animals</span>
        form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living <span
            >animal</span> species have
        been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are
        vertebrates.
