        Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms comprising the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). 
        With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can 
        reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals 
        form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living animal species have 
        been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates.
